# knockoff-diff
So, I made a file comparer in python. It takes in two files as console input and checks to see if they're equal. Before you say "Wait, Phil; isn't diff a thing?" ... well yes, but shut up okay... I didn't know diff existed prior to making it. Besides, can diff insult you if you things are wrong? I thought not.
